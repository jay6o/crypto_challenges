# Cryptopals Challenges

This repo contains my solutions to the Cryptopals Challenges, formerly known as the Matasano Challenges. The sets contain real-world cryptographic vulnerabilities that can be used as attack vectors. I will work on these in Javascript, and have unit tests to go along with each problem (if possible).
