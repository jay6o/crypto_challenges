# Cryptopals Challenges

This repo contains my solutions to the Cryptopals Challenges, formerly known as the Matasano Challenges. The sets contain real-world cryptographic vulnerabilities that can be used as attack vectors. I will work on these in Javascript, and have unit tests to go along with each problem (if possible).

### Usage

#### Installation
`git clone https://github.com/jay6o/crypto_challenges.git && cd ./crypto_challenges && npm install`

#### Testing with Jest  
The test command has been set to run jest by default, so you can run the tests with `npm test`, or run independent tests with `jest ./module.test.js`
